        "You then learned about increasing the complexity and improving the presentation of your plots layer-by-layer.\n",
        "You also learned about commonly used plots for visualizing the distribution of a single variable as well as for visualizing relationships between two or more variables, by leveraging additional aesthetic mappings and/or splitting your plot into small multiples using faceting.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use visualizations again and again throughout this book, introducing new techniques as we need them as well as do a deeper dive into creating visualizations with ggplot2 in @sec-layers through @sec-communication.\n",

        "With the basics of visualization under your belt, in the next chapter we're going to switch gears a little and give you some practical workflow advice.\n",
