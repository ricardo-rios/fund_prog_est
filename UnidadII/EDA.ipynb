        "> \"There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical routines.\" --- Sir David Cox\n",
        "\n",
        "> \"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.\" --- John Tukey\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data.\n",
        "The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation.\n",
        "When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make.\n",
        "\n",
        "EDA is fundamentally a creative process.\n",
        "And like most creative processes, the key to asking *quality* questions is to generate a large *quantity* of questions.\n",
        "It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights can be gleaned from your dataset.\n",
        "On the other hand, each new question that you ask will expose you to a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery.\n",
        "You can quickly drill down into the most interesting parts of your data---and develop a set of thought-provoking questions---if you follow up each question with a new question based on what you find.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research.\n",
        "However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data.\n",
        "You can loosely word these questions as:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  What type of variation occurs within my variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What type of covariation occurs between my variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "The rest of this chapter will look at these two questions.\n",
        "We'll explain what variation and covariation are, and we'll show you several ways to answer each question.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Variation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement.\n",
        "You can see variation easily in real life; if you measure any continuous variable twice, you will get two different results.\n",
        "This is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light.\n",
        "Each of your measurements will include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement.\n",
        "Variables can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g., the eye colors of different people) or at different times (e.g., the energy levels of an electron at different moments).\n",
        "Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information about how that it varies between measurements on the same observation as well as across observations.\n",
        "The best way to understand that pattern is to visualize the distribution of the variable's values, which you've learned about in @sec-data-visualization.\n",
